# Game Interchange Protocol (GameIP)
## Version 1

This file will specify the standard format for data exchanged and stored between systems of the software. These formats will be used in the 
following system interactions:

* Clients and server
* Server and Database
* Server and text files

The format for all data to be exchanged will be that of JSON objects (https://www.json.org/). This means that whenever the client and
server exchange information or the server stores and reads information from a database or text file, a JSON object will be sent with 
the required information. 

This document will be updated throughout the duration of the project as needed.
